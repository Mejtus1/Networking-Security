Volatile and non-volatile data in LINUX 
Linux us a open-source OS that is used extensively for enterprise servers and emoloyee platoforms 

Collecting Volatile Data 
- Hostname, date and time 
- Uptime
- Open ports
- Network information
- Running processes 
- Open files 
- Loaded kernel modules 
- User events
- Swap areas and Disk pertition information 
- Mounted filesystem information
————————————————————
Commands 

hostname - outputs type of OS (example: Ubuntu) 

date - outputs date / time 

cat /etc/timezone - outputs timezone (example: America/Los_Angeles) 

date +%s = calculate the epoch time - time the system was put into working state for the first time 
At internet there are apps for it - example: epoch converter 

uptime - displays how long the system has been running since the last start 

ip addr show = new ipconfig (it is out of date now) 

pomiscious mode on NIC card
ifconfig user/pcname
ifconfig name -promisc

netstat = extract network information 
netstat -rn = displays devices routing table 
ip r = provides data about on information about TCP/IP data packets

collecting open ports
- we use app NMAP for that, 
nmap -sT localhost = make a full TCP connection with local host and scan for open ports 
namp -sU localhost = make a UDP connection with local host and scan for open ports

lsof = list all current open files and active processes associated with them 

cat /proc/cpuinfo = views details about CPU on the machine 
cat/self/mount = view mount points and mounted devices
uname -r = gives information about kernel 
cat /etc/passwd = stores local user account information 
cat /var/log/auth.log = contains information related to the users authentication and autorization events
grep sudo /var/log/auth.log = filters out sudo user information

Different Linux distributions may have slightly different file system structures, but the core structure is common to all distributions. 
These directory locations are used to store specific types of data as follows:

/tmp: Stores temporary files. It is often used as a workspace by applications. Users should not use this directory to store anything of any importance because many Linux distributions wipe this directory on boot, and in a default installation, any user is able to read and write to this directory. Attackers may use this folder to store malware, often as the first stage of an attack, because it is a consistent and permissive directory across Linux installations.

/home: Location where the personal directories for users are stored. These directories should be secured because they often contain private and sensitive information (like configuration files with password, SSH private identity keys, and user files). 

/usr: Used to store user-space programs and data. The reason for the /usr directory is mostly historical, but in modern Linux installations it contains several subdirectories:

    /usr/local: A location set aside for administrators to install software.

    /usr/share: Originally, this directory was used to share files between hosts that could be used on different Linux/Unix platforms. It was designed as a workaround when disk space was at a premium. Today's systems have no such constraints, so it is no longer used in that capacity. 

    /usr/lib: Stores library files that executable programs need to access at run time

    /usr/bin and /usr/sbin: These directories are used to store binary (compiled) executable files. These files make up the bulk of the Linux operating system. The /usr/sbin was traditionally reserved for files that can only be used by root, but that distinction no longer applies.

    /usr/man: This directory is used to store the manual pages, AKA “man pages,” that contain the documentation for important files in the operating system and installed applications.

/dev: Contains device files. Hardware and virtual devices, such as terminals, appear as files to the operating system. When Linux needs to access a device, it often does so by interacting through device files. Unlike other directories here, this folder is "special" in that the files and folders inside are representations of hardware and objects in the kernel. For example, although it appears to be a file, /dev/sda may point to your first hard disk drive, and /dev/urandom is a secure random number generator.

/etc: Stores system configuration files for the operating system and services. For example, SSL keys for web servers, private keys for SSH servers, and user accounts and passwords are kept here. This directory must be kept secure to keep the system secure.

/var: This directory is used by the operating system and applications to store run-time data and log files. There are several subdirectories that are located here, two of which are common to all Linux distributions:

    /var/log: Used by the operating system and applications to store log files. At a minimum, non-privileged users must be prevented from writing to this folder. Otherwise, the integrity of the log files would be compromised after an attack.

    /var/tmp: Used as a workspace to store temporary run-time data for the operating system and running applications.

/bin and /sbin: Used to store system binary files. Traditionally, files stored here were required to boot the operating system. All other system files were stored in the /usr/bin and /usr/sbin directories. But now, many files found in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin are required at boot time.

/lib: Stores library files that must be available to executable files at run time.
