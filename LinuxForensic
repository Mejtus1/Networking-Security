Volatile and non-volatile data in LINUX 
Linux us a open-source OS that is used extensively for enterprise servers and emoloyee platoforms 

Collecting Volatile Data 
- Hostname, date and time 
- Uptime
- Open ports
- Network information
- Running processes 
- Open files 
- Loaded kernel modules 
- User events
- Swap areas and Disk pertition information 
- Mounted filesystem information

Commands 

hostname - outputs type of OS (example: Ubuntu) 

date - outputs date / time 

cat /etc/timezone - outputs timezone (example: America/Los_Angeles) 

date +%s = calculate the epoch time - time the system was put into working state for the first time 
At internet there are apps for it - example: epoch converter 

uptime - displays how long the system has been running since the last start 

ip addr show = new ipconfig (it is out of date now) 

pomiscious mode on NIC card
ifconfig user/pcname
ifconfig name -promisc

netstat = extract network information 
netstat -rn = displays devices routing table 
ip r = provides data about on information about TCP/IP data packets

collecting open ports
- we use app NMAP for that, 
nmap -sT localhost = make a full TCP connection with local host and scan for open ports 
namp -sU localhost = make a UDP connection with local host and scan for open ports

lsof = list all current open files and active processes associated with them 

cat /proc/cpuinfo = views details about CPU on the machine 
cat/self/mount = view mount points and mounted devices
uname -r = gives information about kernel 
cat /etc/passwd = stores local user account information 
cat /var/log/auth.log = contains information related to the users authentication and autorization events
grep sudo /var/log/auth.log = filters out sudo user information
